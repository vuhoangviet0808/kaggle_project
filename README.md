# Kaggle

Welcome to the "Kaggle" repository! This repository contains various code implementations that I have worked on as part of my exploration of Kaggle datasets. The goal of this repository is to practice, learn, and experiment with data analysis, machine learning, and data preprocessing techniques on real-world datasets available on Kaggle.

## Datasets and Projects

This repository includes code for different Kaggle competitions, datasets, and personal data science projects that I have worked on. Each project contains scripts or Jupyter Notebooks to process the data, build machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
